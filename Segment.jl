Segment continuous data by removing artifact indices and creating segments of appropriate length.
Segments shorter than 1 second are removed; segments longer than `max_segment_seconds` are split.
Refactored by Claude Sonnet 4 for improved readability and performance.

# Arguments
- `data`: Input data matrix (samples ร channels)
- `times`: Time vector corresponding to data samples
- `remove_indices`: Indices to remove from data (artifacts and buffer zones)
- `sr`: Sampling rate in Hz
- `max_segment_seconds`: Maximum segment length in seconds (default: 30)

# Returns
- `segments_data`: Vector of data segment matrices
- `segments_times`: Vector of corresponding time vectors

# Notes
- Segments < 1 second are automatically removed
- Segments > max_segment_seconds are recursively split in half
- Z-scoring can be applied to segments after this function
